# Functional TypeScript

Some example TypeScript used in my 2020 talk at ConFoo Montreal.

## Setup

With [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine, run the following
commands from your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delventhalz/functional-typescript.git
cd functional-typescript
npm install
```

## Usage

### Build

To compile the TypeScript files into JS, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output files will be located in the `built/js/` directory.

### Test

To run the unit tests included in the [tests/](./tests) directory, run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Slides

The slides from the talk are available on
[Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vu789n9lCW06DProhAud0vdqCJbaS-W1TjTjaMuvnDg).

## Feedback
